### JavaScript algorithms allow a data operation to function precisely while JavaScript data structures are a method of storing data for efficient access and modification. 
### JavaScript algorithms are a set of programming instructions, known as inputs and outputs, that allow a data operation to function precisely at every execution. 
### Meanwhile, JavaScript data structures are a method of organizing and storing data in a computer for efficient access and modification when necessary. 
### A data structure contains the collection of data values, the operations that can be applied to the data and the relationships that exist between each piece of data.
